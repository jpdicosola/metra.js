metra.js
========

## What is it?
Provides real time depart times for Chicago's Metra lines for the next three upcoming trains.

## Usage

In the config options set the Corridor to the correct line code (see codes.txt). Also set the origin and destination. You may need to look on metra's site to find these, the MD-W line is provided in codes.txt. Not sure what the timestamp parameter does, you shouldn't need to set it.
